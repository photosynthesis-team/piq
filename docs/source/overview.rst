Overview
========


PIQ helps you to concentrate on your experiments without the boilerplate code.
The library contains a set of measures and metrics that is continually getting extended.
For measures/metrics that can be used as loss functions, corresponding PyTorch modules are implemented.

PIQ provides:

* Unified interface, which is easy to use and extend.
* Written on pure PyTorch with bare minima of additional dependencies.
* Extensive user input validation. You code will not crash in the middle of the training.
* Fast (GPU computations available) and reliable.
* Most metrics can be backpropagated for model optimization.
* Supports python 3.6-3.8.
