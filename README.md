<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is intended to become a easy to use yet extensive library with metrics for 
various image-to-image tasks like denoising, super-resolution, image generation etc.


### Prerequisites

* [PyTorch 1.3+](https://pytorch.org) :white_check_mark:  

### Installation
 
Clone the repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/photosynthesis-team/photosynthesis.metrics.git
```

Wheel and pip installations will be added later.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To compute measure or metric, for instance SSIM index, use lower case function from the library:  

```python
import torch

from photosynthesis_metrics import ssim


prediction = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)
target = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)
ssim_index = ssim(prediction, target, data_range=1.)
```

In order to use SSIM as a loss function, use corresponding PyTorch module:

```python
import torch

from photosynthesis_metrics import SSIMLoss


loss = SSIMLoss()
prediction = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256, requires_grad=True)
target = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)
output = loss(prediction, target, data_range=1.)
output.backward()
``` 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/photosynthesis-team/photosynthesis.metrics/issues) for a list of proposed 
features (and known issues).


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please follow [Google Python style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) as a guidance on your code style 
decisions. The code will be checked with [flake-8 linter](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) during the CI pipeline.
