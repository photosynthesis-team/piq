<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

Collection of measures and metrics for automatic image quality assessment in various image-to-image tasks such as 
denoising, super-resolution, image generation etc. 
This easy to use yet flexible and extensive library is developed with focus on reliability and 
reproducibility of results.
Use your favourite measures as losses for training neural networks with ready-to-use PyTorch modules.  

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Getting started  

```python
import torch
from piq import ssim

prediction = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)
target = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)
ssim_index = ssim(prediction, target, data_range=1.)
```


<!-- EXAMPLES -->
### Examples

<!-- PSNR EXAMPLES -->
<details>
<summary>Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)</summary>
<p>

To compute PSNR as a measure, use lower case function from the library.
By default it computes average of PSNR if more than 1 image is included in batch.
You can specify other reduction methods by `reduction` flag.

```python
import torch
from piq import psnr
from typing import Union, Tuple

prediction = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)
target = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256) 
psnr_mean = psnr(prediction, target, data_range=1., reduction='mean')
psnr_per_image = psnr(prediction, target, data_range=1., reduction='none')
```

Note: Colour images are first converted to YCbCr format and only luminance component is considered.
</p>
</details>

<!-- SSIM EXAMPLES -->
<details>
<summary>Structural Similarity (SSIM)</summary>
<p>

To compute SSIM index as a measure, use lower case function from the library:
```python

from piq import ssim
from typing import Union, Tuple

prediction = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)
target = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256) 
ssim_index: Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]] = ssim(prediction, target, data_range=1.)
```

In order to use SSIM as a loss function, use corresponding PyTorch module:
```python
import torch
from piq import SSIMLoss

loss = SSIMLoss(data_range=1.)
prediction = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256, requires_grad=True)
target = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256)

output.backward()
```
</p>
</details>

target = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256) 
ms_ssim_index: torch.Tensor = multi_scale_ssim(prediction, target, data_range=1.)
```

In order to use MS-SSIM as a loss function, use corresponding PyTorch module:

from piq import total_variation

data = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256) 
tv: torch.Tensor = total_variation(data)
```

In order to use TV as a loss function, use corresponding PyTorch module:
```python
import torch
from piq import TVLoss

loss = TVLoss()
prediction = torch.rand(3, 3, 256, 256, requires_grad=True)

By defualt scale weights are initialized with values from the paper. You can change them by passing a list of 4 variables to `scale_weights` argument during initialization. Both GMSD and MS-GMSD computed for greyscale images, but to take contrast changes into account authors propoced to also add chromatic component. Use flag `chromatic` to use MS-GMSDc version of the loss
```python

</p>
</details>

<!-- MSID EXAMPLES -->
<details>
<summary>Multi-Scale Intrinsic Distance (MSID)</summary>
<p>

Use `MSID` class to compute [MSID score](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11141) from image features, 
pre-extracted from some feature extractor network: 
```python
import torch
from piq import MSID

msid_metric = MSID()
prediction_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
target_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
msid: torch.Tensor = msid_metric(prediction_feats, target_feats)
```

If image features are not available, extract them using `_compute_feats` of `MSID` class. 
Please note that `_compute_feats` consumes a data loader of predefined format.
```python
import torch
from  torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from piq import MSID

first_dl, second_dl = DataLoader(), DataLoader()
msid_metric = MSID() 
first_feats = msid_metric._compute_feats(first_dl)
second_feats = msid_metric._compute_feats(second_dl)
msid: torch.Tensor = msid_metric(first_feats, second_feats)
```  
</p>
</details>

<!-- FID EXAMPLES -->
<details>
<summary>Frechet Inception Distance(FID)</summary>
<p>

Use `FID` class to compute [FID score](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500) from image features, 
pre-extracted from some feature extractor network:
```python
import torch
from piq import FID

fid_metric = FID()
prediction_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
target_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
msid: torch.Tensor = fid_metric(prediction_feats, target_feats)
```
 
If image features are not available, extract them using `_compute_feats` of `FID` class. 
Please note that `_compute_feats` consumes a data loader of predefined format.
```python
import torch
from  torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from piq import FID

first_dl, second_dl = DataLoader(), DataLoader()
fid_metric = FID() 
first_feats = fid_metric._compute_feats(first_dl)
second_feats = fid_metric._compute_feats(second_dl)
msid: torch.Tensor = fid_metric(first_feats, second_feats)
```  
</p>
</details>

<!-- KID EXAMPLES -->
<details>
<summary>Kernel Inception Distance(KID)</summary>
<p>

Use `KID` class to compute [KID score](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01401) from image features, 
pre-extracted from some feature extractor network:
```python
import torch
from piq import KID

kid_metric = KID()
prediction_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
target_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
kid: torch.Tensor = kid_metric(prediction_feats, target_feats)
```
 
If image features are not available, extract them using `_compute_feats` of `KID` class. 
Please note that `_compute_feats` consumes a data loader of predefined format. 
```python
import torch
from  torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from piq import KID

first_dl, second_dl = DataLoader(), DataLoader()
kid_metric = KID() 
first_feats = kid_metric._compute_feats(first_dl)
second_feats = kid_metric._compute_feats(second_dl)
kid: torch.Tensor = kid_metric(first_feats, second_feats)
```  
</p>
</details>

<!-- GS EXAMPLES -->
<details>
<summary>Geometry Score (GS)</summary>
<p>

Use `GS` class to compute [Geometry Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02664) from image features, 
pre-extracted from some feature extractor network. Computation is heavily CPU dependent, adjust `num_workers` parameter according to your system configuration:
```python
import torch
from piq import GS

gs_metric = GS(sample_size=64, num_iters=100, i_max=100, num_workers=4)
prediction_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
target_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
gs: torch.Tensor = gs_metric(prediction_feats, target_feats)
```

GS metric requiers `gudhi` library which is not installed by default. 
If you use conda, write: `conda install -c conda-forge gudhi`, otherwise follow [installation guide](http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/python/latest/installation.html).
</p>
</details>

<!-- IS EXAMPLES -->
<details>
<summary>Inception Score(IS)</summary>
<p>

Use `inception_score` function to compute [IS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498) from image features, 
pre-extracted from some feature extractor network. Note, that we follow recomendations from paper [A Note on the Inception Score](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01973.pdf), which proposed small modification to original algorithm:
```python
import torch
from piq import inception_score

prediction_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
mean, variance = inception_score(prediction_feats, num_splits=10)
```
 
To compute difference between IS for 2 sets of image features, use `IS` class.
```python
import torch
from piq import IS


is_metric = IS(distance='l1') 
prediction_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
target_feats = torch.rand(10000, 1024)
distance: torch.Tensor = is_metric(prediction_feats, target_feats)
```
