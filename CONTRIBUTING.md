3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Get your PR reviewed, polished and approved
7. Enjoy making a good open source project even better :wink:


### Code style

Please follow [Google Python style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) as a guidance on your code style 
decisions. The code will be checked with [flake-8 linter](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) during the CI pipeline. 
Standard PyCharm formatter and style checker appears to be more than enough in practice. 
Use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) commit style where possible for simplification of understanding of 
performed changes.

Feel free to reach out to one of contributors if you have any questions.
